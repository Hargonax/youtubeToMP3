# youtubeToMP3
Get a bunch of Youtube v√≠deos as MP3.

We need to create an Excel file where we are indicating all the Youtube videos to download as MP3.

For downloading the Youtube video and convert it to MP3 we need two tools:
    - yt-dlp: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp
    - ffmpeg: https://ffmpeg.org/
    
You need to install yt-dlp and ffmpeg in your system (you can use pip install yt-dlp and make sure to have ffmpeg in you PATH).
An executable version of ffmpeg for MacOs is included in the utils folder.
